Meaningful transitions
===

Sometimes, it is difficult for a user to know where to look or understand how an element got from point A to point B. Carefully choreographed motion design can effectively guide the user’s attention and focus through multiple steps of a process or procedure, avoid confusion when layouts change or elements are rearranged, and improve the overall beauty of the experience. Motion design should serve a functional purpose.

### Visual continuity

Transitioning between two visual states should be clear, smooth and effortless and not confuse the user. A well-designed transition does the heavy lifting and enables the user to clearly understand where their attention should be focused. A transition has three categories of elements:

Incoming elements - whether newly generated or translated into the scene, these items need to be introduced or re-established.
Outgoing elements - elements that are no longer relevant to the new context must be removed from the scene in an appropriate manner.
Shared elements - elements that persist from the start to end of a transition. They can be as subtle as a single icon or become dominant as a gallery image grows to fit the screen.

#### Considerations

When you design your animations, consider the following:

* Think about how the user’s attention should be directed. What elements and motions support that goal? How should incoming, outgoing, and shared elements be emphasized or de-emphasized through the transition?
* Consider transitions when designing screens and find opportunities to create visual connections between transition states through color and persisting elements.
* Add motion judiciously: consider how moving a certain element adds clarity and delight to a transition.


### Hierarchical timing

When building a transition, consider the order and timing of the elements’ movement. Ensure that motion supports the information hierarchy, conveying what content is most important by creating a path for the eye to follow.

However, it’s not a simple formula in which the most important thing moves first and the least important last. The timing of transition elements should flow smoothly and avoid feeling disjointed.


### Consistent choreography

As transitioning elements move around the screen, they should behave in a coordinated manner. The paths elements travel along should all make sense and be orderly. Haphazard motion is distracting.

A well-choreographed app also provides teachable moments. When transitioning elements are coordinated, the user’s understanding of the app grows. They “get” the app; they don’t feel disoriented by the animation.


Best Practices

* Avoid linear spatial paths, except when movement is constrained to an axis or moving towards/away from a specific point in concert with other elements.
* Make sure that the direction in which elements move is cohesive across the transition. Avoid conflicting movements and overlapping paths.
* Consider the depth story: what moves under what, and why?
If all moving elements traced their paths on screen, would it look beautiful and organized? Does it create a clear picture of where to look?
* Support spatial relationships through consistent motions for incoming and outgoing elements.
